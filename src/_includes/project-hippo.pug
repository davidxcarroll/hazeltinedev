The doctors behind Hippo Health have a guess, and they’ve teamed up with Human Design to prove that medical care on your phone can be just as personal as in-office care. Now we can ask those questions that didn’t seem worth a drive to the clinic and stop self diagnosing. As a senior designer at #[a(href='http://humandesign.com' target='_blank') Human Design], I lead the brand and ux/ui for Hippo Health.
