Building a brand identity where you're essentially the target audience is pretty satisfying. It's not every day you get to draw monster skulls and use Zelda screen grabs as a reference. This was a quick project, with just a few rounds of review on the brand and using Squarespace for its many quick yet powerful plug'n'play features."
