			p When I was first introduced to this project, it was an already playable demo with an impressive infrastructure. However,  as the love child of two badass engineers it wasn&rsquo;t much to look at (not to mention the working title was "Word Fart"). After asking a few questions, it was clear that they didn&rsquo;t have much of an identity strategy, much less, any idea of how to present and market this thing. My role quickly came to include branding, illustration, copywriting, marketing, front-end development, and anything else I was able to get my hands on. I&rsquo;m proud of where it has come and it is so close to being done! Standby.
